App to pull trending stock symbols from r/WSB and provide stock information

## Information
This is an application that takes an RSS feed and finds stock symbols being mentioned on the front page of r/WSB. It passes found stock symbols to AlphaVantage API to retrevie stock information.

## Motivation
I created this project because I wanted to see what trending stocks were being mentioned on reddit and as a way to learn about interacting with APIs. This project also started as a C# course project but is turning into my own personal project.

## Build status
Continuous integration. Beginning stages. First solution is based of C# class project so there are superfulous classes and things not needed but were included because of project requirements

## Code style
Standard
